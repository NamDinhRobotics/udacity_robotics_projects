# udacity_robotics_projects
Project Portfolio from Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nano Degree

This repo holds most of the files that were used for each the projects in the Udacity Robotics Software Engineering program.  
Each folder represents a single project and includes a report where applicable.

In some cases I have removed files from the project folders as they turned out to be too large to commit.  These missing files where primarily
models generated by the machine learning algorithms used.
